# Winchester Health Systems

UoW Health System *or WHS* is a hospital management system created as part of final year Software Engineering Module (3206) designed to demonstrate colaboration in the development of a full-stack web application.

The application is hosted on Amazon Web Services using Amplify, Lambda and, PostgreSQL and API Gateway. Currently, the master branch is configured with continuous deployment and integration.

## Features

* Register New Staff
* Define New Roles
* Define Physical Premises
* Create and Manage Cleaning Orders

## Colaborators

This project was completed thanks to the hard work of the following individuals.

* Tristan Day
* Ben Wright
* Brian Anthony
* Ibtisam Kahim

## Documentation

Backend documentation was generated using [Swagger](https://swagger-autogen.github.io/docs/") and [Swagger-Markdown](https://github.com/syroegkin/swagger-markdown).

* To generate docs run ```npm run swagger``` then  ```npm run swagger-markdown```
* Alternatively, you can run the ```aggregate-docs.py``` script, which will generate markdown files for each backend service.

## Testing

* Backend services were tested using [Lambda Local](https://github.com/ashiina/lambda-local) for mocking and [Jest](https://github.com/jestjs/jest) for test scheduling an execution.
* These can be run individually by opening a terminal in the service `src` directory and then running `jest`.

*Note: Due to slight incompatibilities between Lambda Local and Jest, you must manually exit the test using `CTRL + C` to avoid a port conflict when scheduling later tests.*

## Code Formatting

This project was formatted using [Prettier - The Opinionated Code Formatter](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
